# intro: |
# I'm an engineer, entrepreneur and music/arts enthusiast currently working on transforming how we interact with the digital world through using every day objects as interfaces. My previous project VRSUS is a creative application for capturing live music in Virtual Reality and re-creating the concert experience. My other projects have involved pipelines for machine learning, concert recommendation tools, integrations for online advertising and various small web projects. I studied Systems Design and HCI in the context of music. My MA thesis presented methods and studies used in mapping live performance (human) gestures to sound in digital musical instruments.
